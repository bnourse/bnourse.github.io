title: Cultivating a Debugging-Positive Mindset

In the most recent issue of ACM Queue, ["The Debugging Mindset" by Devon H. O'Dell](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3068754), attempts to demystify why debugging is hard and propose some mental models we can use to help make it feel less difficult. I found it particularly interesting since it lies at an intersection of the two things consuming the bulk my time at the moment, improving my programming skills and raising a young kid.  

##  Self-Theories Of Intelligence
The bulk of the paper focuses on viewing debugging, and coding skill development in general, through the lens of self-theories of intelligence. If you have never heard the term it's the idea that everyone falls on a spectrum of ranging from believing that achievement comes through inherent ability to believing achievement comes through hard work. The consensus is that individuals who are successful view hard work as the primary measure of success.

I was familiar enough with the idea that my wife and I have talked about it and make an intentional effort to to promote an "incremental theorist" (achievement through effort) mindset through our encouragements with our son. For instance, saying, "Good work buddy! Keep going!," instead of, "You're so smart! You're so strong!" We have made efforts stop modeling "entity theorist" behaviors like mumbling, "that was stupid," under our breath when we screw up. Despite that, I had not considered how it applies to my coding practice.

## Takeaways

While I think the entire article is a good read, much of it focuses on those on the organizational or educational side. If you're looking for the most obvious takeaways as an individual programmer I suggest a couple of things: 

* Remember that your position on this spectrum can be different for different parts of your life. For instance: it's really common for people to treat graphic arts ability as solidly inherent, despite the fact that most (all?) successful artists spend massive amounts of time and effort to get where they are
* Remember that through effort and the effort of others you *can* move yourself on this spectrum.
* Read the section titled "Reinforcing Incremental Theories for Individuals" for some concrete techniques to promote positive habits.
